LAN File Transfer
=================

LAN File Transfer is a web application that allows a person to transfer files
on a personal LAN. The files are transferred using the P2P Dictionary. The
P2P dictionary also acts as the web server. Interestingly, since there aren't
any write permissions, the P2P web application can be overwritten by uploads
to the dictionary.
